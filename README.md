# Paws-and-Claws

Our goal with Paws-and-Claws is to design the Uber of pet-sitting.
We will create a database recording all of the cats and dogs for Dr. Patil's database in North Carolina.
To out do our rivals such as Rover.com, we will implement a system of training and certification so that the pet sitters we provide will be of a high level of quality.
With this trusted system, our customers, whether traveling or at work, will be able to rely on our application to take care of their beloved pet, and we will be able to truly help our community, as well as make a profit on this new business venture.
